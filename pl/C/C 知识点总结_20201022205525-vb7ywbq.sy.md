### Scope
{: id="20201022210324-7yq54dg"}

Scope describes the region or regions of a program that can access an identifier. A C variable
has one of the following scopes: block scope, function scope, function prototype scope, or file
scope.
{: id="20201022210330-59itslh"}

##### block scope
{: id="20201022210655-00a6j7w"}

the variables cleo and patrick in the following code both have block scope extending to the closing
brace:
{: id="20201022210521-r7kc4bm"}

```c
double blocky(double cleo)
{
double patrick = 0.0;
...
return patrick;
}
```

##### file scope
{: id="20201022205541-3rgdutb"}

A variable with its definition placed outside of any function has file scope. A variable with file
scope is visible from the point it is defined to the end of the file containing the definition. Take
a look at this example
{: id="20201022210716-kp0ysml"}

```
#include <stdio.h>
int units = 0; /* a variable with file scope */
void critic(void);
int main(void)
{
...
}
```
