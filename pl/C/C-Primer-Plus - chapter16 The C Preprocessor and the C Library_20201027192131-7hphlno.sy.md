The C language proper is built on the C keywords, expressions, and statements as well as the
rules for using them. The C standard, however, goes beyond describing just the C language. It
also describes how the C preprocessor should perform, establishes which functions form the standard C library, and details how these functions work. Weâ€™ll explore the C preprocessor and
the C library in this chapter, beginning with the preprocessor.
