The C language proper is built on the C keywords, expressions, and statements as well as the
rules for using them. The C standard, however, goes beyond describing just the C language. It
also describes how the C preprocessor should perform, establishes which functions form the standard C library, and details how these functions work. Weâ€™ll explore the C preprocessor and
the C library in this chapter, beginning with the preprocessor.

The #define preprocessor directive, like all preprocessor directives, begins with the # symbol
at the beginning of a line. The ANSI and subsequent standards permit the # symbol to be
preceded by spaces or tabs, and it allows for space between the # and the remainder of the
directive.
