Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use blocks of 8 bits, or bytes, as the smallest addressable unit of memory. A machine-level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as virtual memory. Every byte of memory is identified by a unique umber, known as its address, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the virtual address space.As indicated by its name, this virtual address space is just a conceptual image presented to the machine-level program
