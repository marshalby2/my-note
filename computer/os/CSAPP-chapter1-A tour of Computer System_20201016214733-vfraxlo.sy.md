The representation of hello.c illustrates a fundamental idea: All information
in a system—including disk files, programs stored in memory, user data stored in
memory, and data transferred across a network—is represented as a bunch of bits.
The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which
we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes
might represent an integer, floating-point number, character string, or machine
instruction.
