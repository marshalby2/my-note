> The representation of hello.c illustrates a fundamental idea: All information

> memory, and data transferred across a network—is represented as a bunch of bits.
> The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which
> we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes
> might represent an integer, floating-point number, character string, or machine
> instruction.
